## Best Practices and Lessons Learned from Security Consulting

At Theori, we are helping our customers improve their security. We plan to share the lessons and experiences of security consulting with customers ranging from start-ups to large enterprises to the public sector over the past few years.

The key takeaway is that each customer will have a unique threat model that depends on their environment. To what degree is determined by the types of attacks the customer anticipates and their overall risk management. As a result, the direction and scale of your company's investment in cybersecurity will vary greatly.

In this talk, we explore some real examples that we encountered during our consulting work. We then present how this should impact cybersecurity at your organization. Finally, we propose effective ways for organizations to train their next generation of white hat hackers.
